# ‚õµÔ∏è ShipDecKK Website Project 

## üìå Project Overview
This project involves creating a professional and responsive five-page website for ShipDecKK, a high-end ship dealership. The site is designed to showcase the company's fleet of yachts, cargo ships, and luxury liners while providing an intuitive user experience. The website features a home page, a gallery, a services page, an about us page, and a subscription form. A Figma prototype was also created as a preliminary design step.

## üìä Key Features
1. **Five-Page Structure**: The website includes a Home, Gallery, Services, About Us, and Subscription page.
2. **Responsive Design**: The site is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices, using meta viewport and @media screen rules for screens under 768px.
3. **Interactive Elements**: The site uses JavaScript for form validation and other interactive features.
4. **Visual Appeal**: The design is attractive and uses five different CSS properties to enhance the user interface.
5. **Figma Prototype**: A separate Figma prototype was designed to guide the website's development, intentionally differing from the final website's aesthetic.
